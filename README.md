# replacefurnituremod
This mod allows replacing furnitures by placing one of a type on top of another of the same type.
As of the moment of writing this readme, the following furnitures have support:
<br><br>
*Chairs<br><br>
*Thrones<br>
*Workbenches<br>
*Benches<br>
*Beds<br>
*Chandeliers<br>
*Hanging Lanterns<br>
*Lamps<br>
*Candles<br>
*Candelabras<br>
*Tables<br>
*Chests<br>
<br>
There are furniture types missing, and I'll add them another time.
