Added support to Sinks, Workbenches, Tombstones, Signs, Pianos and Anvils.
Tinkerers Workbench is now recognized as a table, and can replace tables when placed on top of one.
	Try not to uglify your house with this, though.
Disabled chest replacement due to bugs.
	For the same reason, Dressers can't be manually replaced too.
